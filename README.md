# employee-tracker 
This assignment required me to utilize inquirer a node npm package which assist in capturing user input in Node.js CLI apps, as well as MYSQL a database management system used to deploy cloud native applications. I was instructed to design an employee tracker using these, some challenges I faced along the way were connecting tables to the database and uploading user inputted info. to the database. If I were to have more time on this assignment those are some things I would take more time to correct.
